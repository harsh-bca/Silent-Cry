# Silent Cry — A Safe Space for Silenced Voices

Silent Cry is a revolutionary project aimed at giving children and teens a **confidential platform** to report distressing family situations such as abuse, violence, or emotional trauma — especially when they feel unheard or unsafe speaking out.

## Problem

Millions of children in India experience domestic abuse, emotional neglect, or witness violence. However, due to fear, shame, or lack of safe channels, these issues often go unreported — leading to long-term psychological harm.

There is currently no dedicated, youth-friendly, anonymous digital space in India where children can safely express these experiences or seek help.

## Vision

To create a **child-first, trauma-informed web platform** where:
- Kids can safely report domestic issues anonymously
- AI chatbots offer emotional support
- NGOs, psychologists, or authorities can view reports (with child privacy ensured)
- Data analytics uncover abuse patterns and regional trends

## Core Features (MVP)

- Anonymous Complaint Submission Form
- AI-Powered Emotional Buddy Chatbot
- Peer-to-Peer Story Wall (Optional)
- Dashboard for NGOs to review reports
- Analytical Panel for patterns & alerts (Power BI)

## Tech Stack (Planned for MVP)

- **Frontend:** Bubble.io / Glide (no-code for speed)
- **Backend:** Firebase / Google Sheets
- **Bot:** OpenAI GPT API (for BuddyBot)
- **Dashboard:** Power BI or Google Data Studio
- **Security:** Basic encryption, no login required for children

## Why It's Different

Unlike typical child helplines or complaint portals, *Silent Cry* focuses on:
- Anonymous emotional expression
- AI-supported guidance
- Data-driven insights for systemic change
- A youth-friendly, gamified experience

## Next Steps

1. Design and publish MVP using no-code tools
2. Integrate AI chatbot for emotional guidance
3. Partner with NGOs or mental health professionals
4. Expand to mobile, add regional languages

## Your Role

I'm a **Data Analyst** driving this project with a social mission. I'm currently building the MVP solo and welcome:

- UI/UX designers
- NGO partnerships
- Mentors in mental health / child safety
